# Introduction to Symbiosis Evolution Group bioinformatics pipeline for amplicon sequencing data analysis
We hope that this repository will help you navigate through the analyzes of an example amplicon dataset - a dozen of libraries from our Greenland project.

## Contents - what we will cover here ---
1. Some basic Linux commands.
2. Accessing example data
3. Workflow overview
4. Data splitting into bins corresponding to different targets: MultiPISS script
5. The core amplicon analysis workflow: LSD script
6. Mitochondrial data analysis: MAO script


## 1. Before we start let's get familiar with some Linux commands!
- `pwd` --- where are you? (prints the PATH to your current position).
- `ls` --- listing directory contents.
  - `ls -l` --- lists directory contents while displaying their characteristics  
- `cd` --- changing directories:
  - `cd Workshop` --- change working directory to the directory "Workshop" that is in the current directory
  - `cd ..` --- will move you one level up in your directories tree 
  - `cd` --- by default, typing just 'cd' will take you to your home directory
- `cp` --- copying file, need to be followed by item you want to copy and a path to the directory:
  - `cp /path/to/file.txt .` --- copies a remote "file.txt" to your current working directory, symbolized by a dot (".")
  - `cp Sequences.fasta Workshop/` --- copies a file "Sequences.fasta" from the current working directory to subdirectory "Workshop"
  - `cp -r /path/to/directory ~` --- copy recursively the whole directory/file structure from a remote location to your home directory ("~")
- `mkdir` --- make new directory
  - `mkdir MyNewDirectory` --- will create a directory with the requested name
- `mv` --- move, need to be followed by the name of the item you want to move and a path to the destination directory. Can also be used to rename items.
  - `mv file.txt Workshop/` --- will move a file to the "Workshop" subdirectory
  - `mv OldName.txt NewName.txt` --- will rename your text document
- `rm` --- delete item
  - `rm FileNotNeededAnymore.txt`
  - `rm *.fasta` --- will remove all files with extension "fasta". Asterisk ("*") 

### ...and some additional Linux tools! 
- `screen` --- very usefull tool that 'can be used to multiplexes a physical console between several processes' by creating virtual sessions that you can connect to or disconnect from, as desired. Generally, you want to run your proccesses within a screen to ensure processes are not disrupted by network connection issues! ):
  - `screen -S MyNewSession` --- will create a new session with the requested name. Make it informative!
  - `screen -r MyRunningSession` --- will re-attach you to your session.
  - `screen -ls` --- will list all the session.
  - `ctr + a + d` --- will detach you from a session, without killing it
- `htop` --- starts a 
- `gunzip` --- will uncompress your gzip-compressed files (.fastq.gz ---> .fastq)

**There are many more useful commands and tools - you do want to learn them!**

**Lets use some of those beautiful commends in action!**


## 2. Copying example data to your folder.
- First, log in to your account on *azor* cluster.
- Then, copy the prepared sample data to the directory of your choosing (we recommend using your home directory):
```
cp -r /mnt/matrix/symbio/workshop_march_2022 ~/
```
- Now you have folder "workshop_march_2022" containing R1.fastq and R2.fastq files for each sample.

**Those are uncompressed files, remember that when you obtaine your files from sequencing facility they will be with compressed using gzip (extension: ".fastq.gz") and will need to be decompressed prior to use!
- Go to the copied directory, display the contents:
```
cd ~/workshop_march_2022
ls
ls -l
```

## 3. Amplicon data analysis overview
![alt text](https://github.com/Symbiosis-JU/Bioinformatic-pipelines/blob/main/Pipeline.png?raw=true)
### MultiSPLIT:
- Splits reads of marker genes into seperate subdirectories,
- Passes only reads with tags expected for a given sample.

### LSD (used for both COI and 16S data):
- Analyses each library (sample) separately,
- Merges R1 and R2 reads, passes only high-quality reads,
- Converts fastq to fasta files,
- Dereplicates and denoises samples,
- Assigns taxonomy affiliation to reads,
- Produces zOTU/OTU tables used by other scripts.

### MAO:
- Uses COI zotu table (produced by LSD) as an input,
- creates:
  - table with info about most abundand COI barcode, taxonomy and bacteria presence,
  - fasta file, containing most abundand Eucaryotic COI barcode per each library/sample,
  - table containing information about Eucaryotic COI sequences that represents at least 5% of total Eucaryotic reads per sample,
  - table containing information about bacterial COI sequences.

### QUACK:
- Uses as an input:
  - 16S zotu table (produced by LSD),
  - otus.tax (produced by LSD),
  - list of blanks,
  - list of spikeins,
- Decontaminates 16S data based on negative controls,
- Creates:
  - Table with zotus assigned as: symbiont or contaminants,
  - Decontaminated zotu and otu tables,
  - Statistics table.

### Quantificatiom:
For now you need to do it by yourself in excel as it is shown and explained in this [file](https://github.com/Symbiosis-JU/Bioinformatic-pipelines/blob/main/workshop_march_2022_data.xlsx)

## 4. MultiPISS - splitting libraries into datasets corresponding to different target regions

First, we want to split data for each of the libraries into bins representing our target genes, and from each library, delete reads with tags other than those expected for a given sample.
To do that we are going to use our [MultiPISS.py](https://github.com/Symbiosis-JU/Bioinformatic-pipelines/blob/main/multiPISS.py) script:
1. Click on the link above and copy it (by clicking the icon 'copy raw contents' in the right upper corner of the box).
2. use command:
``` nano MultiPISS.py```.
This will create an empty file named MultiPISS.py. Paste the script and exit file by ctr + x with saving the changes.
3. Make this script executable by using command: ```chmod +x MultiPISS.py```.

**Now you can run script!**
Type ```./MultiPISS.py``` (```./``` --- indicates that this file is in the current directory).

Oh no! You've got an ERROR!:

```
ERROR! CHECK YOUR INPUT PARAMETERS!
Please provide:
1) sample list with information about your libraries created in following manner (tab-separated):
Sample_name Sample_name_R1.fastq	Sample_name_R2.fastq
Please remember to first un-gzip your .gz files!!!
2) FULL path to the directory with R1 and R2 fiels for all the amplicon libraries that you want to analyse e.g.:
/home/Data/For/Nature/Publication/)
shortcuts such as "./" are unlikely to work
3) output directory path.
4) Information whether the last two characters of your sample name indicate well number
1=True, 0=False
If you claim 1 but the last two characters are not numbers, it may create an error!
5) Number of cores to use
```

As you can see, we need to provide some input parameters for our script.

#### Sample_list:

**You can make it in Excel or using other tools. Or run the following command in the directory with your R1 and R2 files:**

```
rm sample_list.txt   #removing any potentially corrupted files that might exist already
for file in *_R1.fastq; do
    SampleName=`basename $file _R1.fastq `
    SampleNameMod=$(echo "$SampleName" | sed 's/-/_/g' | sed 's/_S[0-9]\+$//g')
    echo $SampleNameMod "$SampleName"_R1.fastq "$SampleName"_R2.fastq >> sample_list.txt
done
```
**Now we are ready to run the MultiPISS script for real!**
Use following command:
```
./MultiPISS.py sample_list.txt ~/workshop_march_2022 ~/workshop_march_2022/split 0 20
```
This command will run our script using created sample_list, output it without visualization in the 'split' subdirectory using 20 cores.

Type: 
```
cd ~/workshop_march_2022/split
```
and then:
```
ls
```

Now you can see that you have four new subdirectories: **COI_trimmed  incorrect_untrimmed  V12_trimmed  V4_trimmed**
- COI_trimmed --- containes mitochondrial COI reads with trimmed primers sequences,
- V12_trimmed --- containes bacterial 16S V1-V2 reads with trimmed primers sequences,
- V4_trimmed --- containes bacterial 16S V4 reads with trimmed primers sequences,
- incorrect_untrimmed --- with sequences that were unrecognize by the script with primers still attached.
Let's now look at the contents of these folders:

```
ls -l COI_trimmed/
```

Let's look at an example file. Command `head` displays the top lines, that should give us a sense of the contents. Do you remember the fastq format?

```
head -12 COI_trimmed/GRE1805_F_COI.fastq
```

You may want to check the numbers of reads that were classified to each category.
We can do this by counting how many times the conserved first portion of the read name
("A00187") appears in each of the pre-split and post-split files. The numbers should agree!

```
cd ~/workshop_march_2022
grep -c "@A00187" GRE1805_R1.fastq
grep -c "@A00187" split/*/GRE1805_F*     ### ...where "split" is the name of your post-splitting data folder
```

**Let's proceed with COI data analysis!**



## 5. LSD script
This is the core amplicon analysis workflow. 
This script joins F and R (R1 and R2) reads, passing only high-quality ones. 
Next it converts fastq to fasta file, dereplicate and denoise sequences in each library seperately.
Joins all the libraries into one table and assigns all the sequences to taxonomy.
**This is a first step of analysis of bacterial 16S and COI data!**

Again, go to our repository and copy [LSD.py](https://github.com/Symbiosis-JU/Bioinformatic-pipelines/blob/main/LSD.py).
Copy it.
Use ```nano LSD.py``` to create an empty file **in the directory you have your marker gene reads** (for COI: ~/workshop_march_2022/split/COI_trimmed).
Close it with saving changes and make this file executable with ```chmod +x LSD.py```.

Again if you will type just ```./LSD.py``` you will get an error about putting some parameters. In this case:
```
ERROR! CHECK YOUR INPUT PARAMETERS!
Please provide:
1) sample list with information about your libraries created in following manner:
Sample_name Sample_name_R2.fastq Sample_name_R2.fastq
Please remember to first un-gzip your .gz files!!!
2) path to the directory with R1 and R2 fiels for all the amplicon libraries that you want to analyse e.g.:
/home/Data/For/Nature/Publication/)
3) type of data, please indicate if you are going to analyse 16SV4, 16SV1-V2 (Bacterial) or COI.""")
```
So, again we need a sample list. But this time as an input we are using an output of MultiPISS.
Now our imput files for COI analysis looks like this:
```
GRE2290_F_COI.fastq
GRE2290_R_COI.fastq
```
We will use simmilar (**but not the same**) commend as before:
```
for file in *_F_COI.fastq; do
    SampleName=`basename $file _F_COI.fastq `
    SampleNameMod=$(echo "$SampleName" | sed 's/-/_/g' | sed 's/_S[0-9]\+$//g')
    echo $SampleNameMod "$SampleName"_F_COI.fastq "$SampleName"_R_COI.fastq >> sample_list_COI.txt
done
```
**Running LSD.py:**
As this part may take a while **remember to use screen session!**:
```
screen -S LSD
```
and then:
```
./LSD.py sample_list_COI.txt ~/workshop_march_2022/split/COI_trimmed COI
```
Now you have **A LOT** of files. But for now the most important for you is:
```
zotu_table_expanded.txt
```
This is a table with all the COI sequences in all your libraries assigned to a various taxonomic levels.
You can use it for your analysis
OR
You can use it as an imput for [MAO.py](https://github.com/Symbiosis-JU/Bioinformatic-pipelines/blob/main/MAO.py) script!

## MAO script
This script is simple, but brilliant at the same time.
It uses ```zotu_table_expanded.txt``` of COI data as an in input and produces:
- barcode.txt that contains info about most abundand COI barcode, taxonomy and bacteria presence
- barcode.fasta, containing most abundand Eucaryotic COI barcode per each library/sample
- euc5.txt, containing information about Eucaryotic COI sequences that represents at least 5% of total Eucaryotic reads per sample
- bac.txt, containing information about bacterial COI sequences

Just do our trick with creating an ampty file with ```nano MAO.py```, paste the script and close the file with saving.
Make script executable with ```chmod +x MAO.py``` and run it with ```./MAO.py zotu_table_expanded.txt```.

## QUACK script
This script is used for decontamination of 16S data.
**Be aware that we are working with insects. If you are working with a different data type, consider applying some changes to fit your needs.**
For example, this script deletes all reads characterized as chloroplasts by default, so if you are working with lichens, that may cause a lot of damage (happened before).

**Before running this script you need to run LSD for you 16S data (eg. V4)**
Go to the directory with V4 reads:
```
cd ~/workshop_march_2022/split/V4_trimmed
```
Create a **sample_list** in similar manner as with COI data:
```
for file in *_F_V4.fastq; do
    SampleName=`basename $file _F_V4.fastq `
    SampleNameMod=$(echo "$SampleName" | sed 's/-/_/g' | sed 's/_S[0-9]\+$//g')
    echo $SampleNameMod "$SampleName"_F_V4.fastq "$SampleName"_R_V4.fastq >> sample_list_V4.txt
done
```
You can copy the LSD script used for COI data, as it is the same for 16S:
```
cp ~/workshop_march_2022/split/COI_trimmed/LSD.py ~/workshop_march_2022/split/V4_trimmed
```
**Remember that when you copy executable script, you don't need to make it executable again**

Now, run LSD for you 16S V4:
```
./LSD.py sample_list_V4.txt ~/workshop_march_2022/split/V4_trimmed 16SV4
```

OK, we have all inputs to run **QUACK**

To run Quack you need:
- the actual script! Copy it from [QUACK.py](https://github.com/Symbiosis-JU/Bioinformatic-pipelines/blob/main/QUACK.py) and change permissions to make executable, as before!
- zotu table produced by LSD (zotu_table_expanded.txt),
- otus.tax, also produced by LSD,
- list of blanks --- tab separated text file with names of blank (negative control) libraries with description (PCR/Extraction_blank). 
In our case, you may want to create a file "blank_list.txt" that looks like this:
```
NegExtr_GRE0619  blank_extr
NegExtr_GRE0643  blank_extr
NegPCR_GRE0692  blank_PCR
NegPCR_GRE1092	blank_PCR
```
...or perhaps like this? Depending on your actual sample names. Make sure that they are correct!
```
GRE0619_Neg_extr  blank_extr
GRE0643_Neg_extr	blank_extr
GRE0692_Neg_PCR blank_PCR
GRE1092_Neg_PCR blank_PCR
```

- list of spikeins used --- tab separated text file with names of used spikeins with description (PCR/Extraction_spikein).
In our case, you may want to create a file "spikeins.txt" and with the contents as below.
```
Ec5502	Extr_Spikein
Ec5001	PCR_Spikein
```
- ThresholdA --- a unique genotype will be assigned as a contaminant UNLESS the maximum relative abundance it attains in at least one experimental library is more than ThresholdA * of the maximum relative abundance it attains in any blank library. Recommended value: 10
- ThresholdB --- a unique genotype assigned previously as a symbiont will be assigned as "Other" UNLESS the maximum relative abundance it attains in at least one experimental library is more than ThresholdB. Recommended value: 0.001
- ThresholdC --- a library will be deleted UNLESS the % of contamination will be lower than ThresholdC. Recommended value: 30

OK, everything checked? Let's run this baby!:
```
./QUACK.py zotu_table_expanded.txt blank_list.txt spikein.txt otus.tax 10 0.001 30
```
If everything went well, script should print to a screen following message:
```
